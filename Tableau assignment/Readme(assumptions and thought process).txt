Data Cleaning process -
1. After reading the dataframe first I checked for null values and 
I removed two columns whose 20% of the values were null and I also 
removed the unncessary unamed:0 column.
2. I then fixed the spelling mistakes with the borough names.
3. Now it was time to check for outliers and this dataframe had some 
extreme ones.
4. I set the lower threshold to be 1st quantile as cheap properties 
are quite useful as a listing and I set the upper limit as the usual 75th quantile.
5. Then I basically applied the usual command to rmeove outliers.
6. I was satisfied with the boxplots later on and I exported it into a csv file 
which I later on converted to an xlsx file in excel.

Assumptions- 
1. First major assumption I made was I assumed all properties listed are 
residential properties.
2. Next I assumed all the prices listed are the revenues generated by them with 
respect to the availability days.
3. Of the questions to answer I have answered questions 1 to 6 in the presentation.
4. Regarding question 4 the calculations -

revenue per unit in a year
bronx = 160.44 x 75.55 = 12121.24
brooklyn = 98.59 x 108.44 = 10691.09
manhatten = 105.74 x 149.80 = 15839.86
queens = 144.47 x 89.66 = 12953.18
staten island = 198.49 x 90 = 17864.1
